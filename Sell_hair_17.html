    <h2>Jim tells you he sold his watch to buy the comb set. <br>
        You both sit and silently eat dinner sadly thinking about what could have been.<br>
        Both Della & Jim sold the most valuable thing they owned in order to buy a gift for the other. <br>
        The moral of the story is we often don't value what we truly should.</h2>
